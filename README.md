# CustomerSegments
Use unsupervised learning techniques to see if any similarities exist between customers and how to best segment customers into distinct categories.
## Purpose:
In this project I apply unsupervised learning techniques on product spending data collected for customers of a fictitious wholesale distributor in Lisbon, Portugal to identify customer segments hidden in the data. I first explored the data by selecting a small subset to sample and determined if any product categories highly correlate with one another. Afterwards, I preprocessed the data by scaling each product category and then identifying (and removing) unwanted outliers. With the good, clean customer spending data, I then applied PCA transformations to the data and implement clustering algorithms to segment the transformed customer data. Finally, I compared the segmentation found with an additional labeling and considered ways this information could assist the wholesale distributor with future service changes.
## How to use:
The project has 4 files:
* customer_segments.html: Final Report
* customer_segments.ipynb: This is the main file where my work was performed the project.
* customers.csv: The project dataset.
* visuals.py: This Python script contains helper functions that create the necessary visualizations.
